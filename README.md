# WebPageGeneratorWinForms
Full Site Builder created using C# and Windows Forms.
This is an application in Romanian which serves as a quick way to create new Web Pages based on basic templates (also created by me).
There are 2 options of templates and several ways to change the style of the page like choosing the position of the menu, the position of the logo on the page, the 
main description or main picture, the style of the cards which act as a resume of the other pages and, of course, the colour template of the page.
This application is a prototype and it should be treated as so.
